## Before using, a note From Skelli
> A complete upgrade for FireRed, including an upgraded Battle Engine. By using this or any assets from this repository, you consent to **never making money off your game** (unless you have my explicit permission). That includes both pay-walls as well as optional donations (which includes ko-fi, Patreon, etc.). If you have a problem with this, feel free to send me a Discord message (Skeli#3917) and I will give you my PayPal so you can pay me $100000 for the hundreds if not thousands of hours I poured into this for free (I don't actually want your money - I'm trying to make a point). Not to mention it's illegal to profit off of an IP you don't own.
