# How to Patch UCDEP

Patching Ucdep is similar to patching
any other rom hack, but with some extra steps.

# Resources Needed

Hex Maniac Advance(HMA)

A Clean *Legal* Pokémon Fire Red 1.0 Rom

Ucdep files(UCDEP.ups e UCDEP.html)

### First Step
Open your Fire Red rom with HMA

### Second Step
Drag the UCDEP.ups file into HMA, and wait the
patch to be applied, then close HMA

### Third Step
Copy UCDEP.toml to the same directory as your
patched rom, then rename UCDEP.toml to the same
name as your patched rom
Both files *need* to have the same name to HMA
be able to read the rom.

### Fourth Step
Open your Patched rom with HMA, if it works,
the Pokémon shortcut icon should be Tinkaton

### Enjoy!
